# decap-proxy

A Cloudflare Worker Github OAuth proxy for [Decap CMS](https://github.com/decaporg/decap-cms). This allows for deploying
Decap without the Netlify Identity or Git Gateway services required to handle Github authentication so that the CMS
client can make Github API calls.

This proxy is intended to be deployed on its own subdomain, separate from whatever website domain you're using Decap
with.

## Getting Started

### Create a Github OAuth App

You'll need to [configure a Github OAuth application](https://github.com/settings/applications/new).
Your `Application callback URL` must be the domain you deploy your worker to with the `/callback` path. Based on the
sample configuration below, that would mean `https://my.domain.com/callback`.

Save the OAuth client ID and secret for later, you'll need to provide those secrets to the worker.

### Configure & Deploy the Worker

Clone the repo and `cp wrangler.toml.sample wrangler.toml`.

Configure / login with wrangler (`yarn global add wrangler && wrangler login`).

Deploy after tweaking your wrangler.toml as needed (`yarn deploy`).

Note that you'll likely want to make the following change to your wrangler.toml:

```diff
name = "decap-proxy"
main = "src/index.ts"
compatibility_date = "2024-04-19"
compatibility_flags = ["nodejs_compat"]

+workers_dev = false
+route = { pattern = "my.domain.com", zone_name = "my.domain" }
```

Where `zone_name` is a domain you already host on cloudflare for DNS, and `pattern` is the subdomain you've chosen (if
different). You'll also likely need to login to the Cloudflare admin site and configure the custom domain for your
worker so that the DNS record is added (nested
under: `Workers & Pages` > `Your Worker (decap-proxy)` > `Settings` > `Triggers` > `Add Custom Domain`).

Disabling `workers_dev` is how you disable the default workers.dev preview domain, if that's something you want.

#### Configure OAuth Secrets

Using the OAuth application credentials you saved from the first section, you'll enter these as `GITHUB_OAUTH_ID`
and `GITHUB_OAUTH_SECRET` secret values for your worker (nested
under: `Workers & Pages` > `Your Worker (decap-proxy)` > `Settings` > `Variables` > `Edit Variables` and set them to be
**encrypted**).

### Point to Proxy in Decap Config

Add the `base_url` for your proxy to the backend section of Decap's `config.yml`:

```diff
site_url: https://your-site-powered-by-decap.com
search: false
backend:
  name: github
  branch: main
  repo: "github-user/repo"
+  base_url: https://decap.mydomain.com
```
